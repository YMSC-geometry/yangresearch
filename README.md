My research interests lie in the intersection between differential geometry and algebraic geometry. Some specific topics are: Riemannian geometry, Kähler geometry, Calabi-Yau manifolds, almost-complex, symplectic and Hermitian geometry, geometric flows, complex Monge-Ampère equations, transcendental and algebraic methods in algebraic geometry.



The following are some of my recent works:

1. Xiaokui Yang,  *RC positivity, rational connectedness and Yau's conjecture*.  **Camb. J. Math.** 6 (2018), 183-212.</span>

In this paper, we introduce a new curvature notion "RC-positivity" for abstract vector bundles and by using this notion we prove a long-standing conjecture of S.-T. Yau (Problem 47 of his Problem Section, 1982 ) affirmatively that compact Kahler manifolds with positive holomorphic sectional curvature must be algebraic and rationally connected.



2. K.-F. Liu, S. Rao, Xiaokui Yang,  Quasi-isometry and deformations of Calabi-Yau manifolds.  **Invent. Math.** 199 (2015), no. 2, 423-453. 

We prove that the formal expansion of Beltrami differentials for the deformation of Calabi-Yau manifolds has at least radius 1 which was previously well-known to be sufficiently small (Kodaira-Spencer-Kuranishi theory). The proof is based on two Hodge-theoretical theorems on general compact Kahler manifolds and also the hypoelliptic theory of holomorphic currents of pure-type. For two Hodge-theoretical results, one (so called “quasi-isometry”) is an analogue of Hormander’s classical L2-estimates, and the other one is analogous to Cartan’s formula, which is also a generalization of the well-known Tian-Todorov Lemma on Calabi-Yau manifolds.



3. Xiaokui Yang,  A partial converse to the Andreotti-Grauert theorem.    **Compositio Math.**  155  (2019)  no. 1, 89-99. 

In this paper, we prove that on a compact complex manifold, the dual line bundle L* is not pseudo-effective if and only if L is RC-positive, i.e. it admits a smooth Hermitian metric such that its Ricci curvature has at least one positive eigenvalue everywhere. By using this result we obtain a weak dual of the classical Cartan-Serre-Grothendieck-Kodaira theorem. Moreover, we establish that a projective manifold is uniruled if and only if its first Chern class is RC-positive, i.e. there exists a smooth Kahler metric such that its Ricci curvature is RC-positive, which was also conjectured by S.-T. Yau.



4. V. Tosatti, Xiaokui Yang,  An extension of a theorem of Wu-Yau.  **J. Differential Geom.** 107 (2017), no.3, 573-579.

In this paper, we prove that if a compact Kahler manifold has non-positive holomoprhic sectional curvature then its canonical line bundle is nef, and if it has a Kahler metric with negative holomorphic sectional curvature, then its canonical line bundle is ample. It solves a conjecture of S.-T. Yau in 1970s. The proof is based on Wu-Yau's method.
